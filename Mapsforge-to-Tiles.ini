# gm_cmd
#   Command to run GraphicsMagick's "gm" executable from command line
#   Either fully qualified path of "gm" executable (.exe)
#   or name of "gm" executable if resolved by search path
#   Resource limits of GraphicsMagick are hardcoded in tcl script file

# magick_cmd
#   Command to run ImageMagick's "magick" executable from command line
#   Either fully qualified path of "magick" executable (.exe)
#   or name of "magick" executable if resolved by search path

#   'Set resource limits of ImageMagick'
# Note on "gm_cmd" and "magick_cmd" variables:
#   Set "gm_cmd" and/or "magick_cmd" variable.
#   Set both "gm_cmd" and "magick_cmd" variables in order
#   to be able to switch between GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick.
#   If value of "gm_cmd" and/or "magick_cmd" variable is empty,
#   script will try to find an appropriate executable.

# tile_size
#   Pixels per direction on map, will be resized to 256 pixels on output
#   (Default: 256, i.e. no pixel resizing required)
# language
#   Preferred Mapsforge maps language (2 lowercase letters ISO 639-1 code)
#   (e.g. "en", "fr", "de" etc. or "" for Mapsforge default language)
# tcp_port
#   TCP port for communication between Mapsforge tile server and application
#   (1024 <= port <= 65535)
# interface
#   Mapsforge tile server network interface for listening to incoming requests
